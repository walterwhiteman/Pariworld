Generate a complete, runnable web application for a private, two-person chat. The application should be designed for exclusive use between two individuals.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Private Two-Person Chat:**
    * The application must facilitate real-time text messaging between exactly two users.
    * For simplicity and privacy, implement a mechanism where both users enter a shared, secret "room ID" or "passcode" to join the same chat session. This avoids complex user authentication for this specific use case.
    * Messages should be displayed chronologically in a scrollable chat window.

2.  **Real-time Text Messaging:**
    * Users should be able to type messages into an input field and send them by pressing Enter or clicking a 'Send' button.
    * Messages should appear instantly for both participants.
    * Visually distinguish between messages sent by the local user and messages received from the remote user (e.g., different background colors or alignment for chat bubbles).

3.  **Image Sharing Feature:**
    * Provide a clear button or input element that allows users to select and upload an image from their local device.
    * Once an image is selected and sent, it should be displayed directly within the chat interface for both users.
    * For transmission, convert the image to a Base64 string on the client-side and send it via Socket.IO. Display the Base64 string as an `<img>` tag on the receiving end.

**Stretch Goal (Video Call Feature - if feasible within a single generation):**

* Implement a basic one-to-one video call functionality.
* Include buttons to "Start Video Call" and "End Video Call."
* Display the local user's video stream and the remote user's video stream within the application.
* Utilize WebRTC for peer-to-peer video communication. If WebRTC significantly complicates the initial generation, prioritize the text and image chat features, and provide a placeholder for future video integration.

**Technical Stack & Structure:**

* **Frontend:** React (functional components, hooks) with Tailwind CSS for styling.
    * All React components and logic should be contained within a single `App.js` file (or similar main component).
    * The `index.html` file should serve as the entry point, loading the React app.
    * Ensure the design is fully responsive for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    * Use `lucide-react` for any necessary icons (e.g., send, image upload, video call).
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.
* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO for both frontend and backend to handle real-time messaging and image sharing.
* **Project Structure:**
    * Provide all necessary files for a complete, runnable Replit project:
        * `index.html` (main HTML file)
        * `src/App.js` (main React component)
        * `src/index.js` (React entry point)
        * `server.js` (Node.js backend)
        * `package.json` (for dependencies like React, Express, Socket.IO, Tailwind CSS setup)
        * `tailwind.config.js` (basic Tailwind config)
    * The server should listen on `process.env.PORT` or a default port (e.g., 3000).

**Code Quality & Best Practices:**

* **Comments:** Include extensive, clear comments throughout the code to explain logic, component functions, and server routes.
* **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for network issues or failed operations (e.g., image loading errors).
* **No Alerts:** Do NOT use `alert()` or `confirm()` for user notifications. Implement custom modal or in-app message displays if needed.
* **Dependencies:** Ensure `package.json` lists all required dependencies correctly.
* **Firebase:** Do NOT use Firebase for this application, as the request is for a simple two-person chat without persistent storage or complex authentication.
* **Styling:** Make the UI visually appealing with rounded corners, appropriate spacing, and a clean layout using Tailwind CSS classes.
